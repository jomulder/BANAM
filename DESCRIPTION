Description: The network autocorrelation model (NAM) can be used for studying the degree of social influence 
    regarding an outcome variable based on one or more known networks. 
    The degree of social influence is quantified via the network autocorrelation parameters. In case of a single
    network, the Bayesian methods of Dittrich, Leenders, and Mulder
    (2017) <DOI:10.1016/j.socnet.2016.09.002> and Dittrich, Leenders, and Mulder (2019)
    <DOI:10.1177/0049124117729712> are implemented using a normal, flat, or independence  
    Jeffreys prior for the network autocorrelation. In the case of multiple 
    networks, the Bayesian methods of Dittrich, Leenders, and Mulder (2020) 
    <DOI:10.1177/0081175020913899> are implemented using a multivariate normal prior for 
    the network autocorrelation parameters. Flat priors are implemented 
    for estimating the coefficients. For Bayesian testing of equality and order-constrained 
    hypotheses, the default Bayes factor of Gu, Mulder, and Hoijtink, (2018) 
    <DOI:10.1111/bmsp.12110> is used with the posterior mean and posterior covariance 
    matrix of the NAM parameters based on flat priors as input.
